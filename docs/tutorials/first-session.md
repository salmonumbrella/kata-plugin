# First session

Use an empty exercise folder. Install your harness plugin using the [installation guide](../how-to/install.md), then create a disposable Kata project:

```sh
scratch=$(mktemp -d)
export KATA_HOME="$scratch/store"
unset KATA_SERVER KATA_DAEMON KATA_AUTH_TOKEN KATA_REF KATA_TEAMMATE KATA_INBOX_USER KATA_SESSION_ID
mkdir "$scratch/workspace"
cd "$scratch/workspace"
git init -b main
kata init --project example
```

Set a Git identity if one is not already configured. Keep this environment in the terminal that launches the harness.

## Claude Code

Launch Claude with the plugin. Ask: “Use one foreground Agent to create a small Python function and unittest, run the tests, commit the files, and close its assigned Kata issue with that evidence. Then report the result.”

The first delegation creates an automatic session parent. The child receives its issue and teammate identity. After it completes and the lead settles, `/kata` shows the binding and children. Inspect `kata list --status all` in the same exercise folder. The child and automatic parent should be closed; use `kata show <ref>` to inspect evidence and any review label.

## Oh-my-pi

Start OMP; no configuration is needed. To see the default-project behavior, run it in a folder with no Kata project: the plan lands in the project registered for the folder, or in `KATA_DEFAULT_PROJECT` labeled with the folder name. Ask: “Use todo to plan two tasks: implement a small function, then test it. Complete each task with a substantive message and passing test or commit evidence. Let the plugin close the automatic parent.”

Use `/todo` to see the plan. A task stays unfinished if Kata refuses its close. Once both children are closed, inspect `kata list --status all` and `kata show <parent-ref>`.

## Pi

Start pi with the package loaded. Use the same two-task prompt. `/todo` is supplied by this plugin. If the assistant stops with actionable work remaining, a bounded hidden reminder can request continuation. Pi does not track subagents.

Inspect the closed children and automatic parent with `kata list --status all`. Explicit `KATA_REF` parents remain manually managed in every harness.

## Finish

Exit the harness, then run `kata daemon stop` with the same throwaway `KATA_HOME`. Keep or remove the exercise directory when you no longer need the records.
